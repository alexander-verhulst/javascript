# My First Readme

It is April 14, 2020 and this is my first readme document. I am currently preparing for a coding bootcamp and studying Javascript. I plan on attending a coding bootcamp this year. I am getting familar with Github and VS Code. 

## My First Section
I created my first section on my readme document and will practice uploading a new Javascript file to Github. I will try adding or editing a new file every day.
